            <h2>Eugene Wolfson, "Hydrocarmandias", 2024</h2>
<p>
I met a traveller from an antique land

Who said: One vast and whole form of plastic

Stands in the desart. There, over the sand,

Full cast, a perfect visage frowns, whose beck,

And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,

Tell that its sculptor well those passions read

Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,

The hand that mocked them and the heart that fed:

And on the pedestal these words appear:

"My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings:

Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!"

Each thing beside remains. Round the display

Of that colossal wrought, boundless and bare

The lode and laurel sights stretch far away.</p>

<p>
I met a traveller from an antique land

Who said: Two vast and trunkless legs of stone

Stand in the desart. Near them, on the sand,

Half sunk, a shattered visage lies, whose frown,

And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,

Tell that its sculptor well those passions read

Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,

The hand that mocked them and the heart that fed:

And on the pedestal these words appear:

"My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings:

Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!"

No thing beside remains. Round the decay

Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare

The lone and level sands stretch far away.</p>
